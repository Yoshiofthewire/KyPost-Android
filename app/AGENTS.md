# Purpose

Owns the Android app module build, manifest, source sets, resources, and test execution.

# Ownership

- Module: `app/`
- Build contract: `app/build.gradle.kts`
- Runtime package root: `app/src/main/java/com/urlxl/mail/`

# Local Contracts

- Per-device `deviceId`/`deviceSecret` pairing (`X-Kypost-Device-Id`/`X-Kypost-Device-Secret`
  headers, `PairingAuthHeaders.kt`) is the single auth mechanism for every backend call the app
  makes: native push pull, contact sync (`/api/contacts/sync`), groups (`/api/groups`), PGP QR
  token mint (`/api/pgp/qr/token`), mail relay (`/api/inbox`, `/api/inbox/folders`,
  `/api/inbox/actions`, `/api/mail/draft`, `/api/mail/send`), MFA push-respond
  (`/api/mfa/push/respond`), and self-deregistration (`/api/notifications/native/deregister`).
  `deviceSecret` is minted server-side once per successful `POST
  /api/notifications/native/register` call and returned only in that response — the app must
  persist whatever it receives unconditionally, overwriting any prior value, since every
  successful register invalidates the previous secret. No bearer tokens, no cookies, no separate
  mobile login. (Replaces the earlier account-wide `sub`/`hash` shared-secret scheme, which the
  backend removed entirely — no dual-auth fallback.)
- Pairing proof material lives in a Keystore-backed `EncryptedSharedPreferences` file
  (`SecurePairingStore`), not plaintext DataStore — see `app/src/main/AGENTS.md` for the exact
  storage split. Non-secret sync state (cursors, delivery mode, history) is plaintext DataStore.
- Deep-link contract for pairing is `kypost://native-pair` with required `sub`, `srv`, and
  `pt` params (`reg` optional). `hash` is no longer part of the contract — the per-device secret
  is issued only via the registration response, never carried in the pairing QR/deep-link. The
  legacy `novu-pair` scheme is removed entirely.
- Unpairing (`PushHomeViewModel.unpairDevice()`) calls `POST
  /api/notifications/native/deregister` with the device's own credentials before clearing local
  state; the local clear (and periodic pull-worker cancellation) happens unconditionally even if
  that call fails (offline, already-removed).
- Keep app behavior aligned with project goal: IMAP inbox read, SMTP send, keyword-based tab
  filtering, PLUS an alternate backend-relay connection mode (`MailConnectionMode.RELAY` in
  `MailSettings`, default `MANUAL_IMAP` so existing installs are unaffected) and two-way contact
  sync (`contacts/` package). A local Room database (`data/AppDatabase`) is the UI's read model for
  mail regardless of which connection mode supplied it, and the persistence layer for contacts.
- Prefer one existing dependency for both IMAP and SMTP.
- Avoid hardcoded secrets in committed files.
- For user-visible behavior changes, update this file or a closer child AGENTS.md.
- Contact autocomplete (ContactAutocomplete.md): `ComposeActivity`'s TO/CC/BCC fields are
  `RecipientInputView`s backed by `ContactDao.search` (name/email substring match, debounced
  150ms, top 5 shown). The address-book icon on the TO row opens `AddressBookSheet`
  (`contacts/` package), a `BottomSheetDialogFragment` offering TO/CC/BCC actions per contact.
  Both surfaces share `RecipientCandidate`/`RecipientField`/matching logic in
  `contacts/RecipientMatching.kt` — extend that file, don't duplicate matching logic in either UI
  layer.

# Work Guidance

- Choose the smallest diff that fixes root cause.
- Reuse existing classes and Android components before adding new abstractions.
- Keep background behavior explicit; document Android lifecycle limits.
- Mark intentional ceilings with `ponytail:` comments and upgrade path.

# Verification

- Run unit tests for logic changes under `app/src/test/`.
- Run unit tests for push parser/mapper changes under `app/src/test/`.
- Run Android instrumentation tests when UI/manifest behavior changes under `app/src/androidTest/`.
