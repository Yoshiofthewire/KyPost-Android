     * Delegates to the canonical [com.urlxl.mail.contacts.toDto] (in `ContactMappers.kt`) rather
     * than duplicating its JSON decode logic. This used to be its own partial implementation that
     * only carried the pre-Task-2 fields (fn/org/notes/birthday/emails/phones/addresses) — since
     * this function's result is the merge base in [DeviceContactRepository.pullDeviceChangesForOwnAccount]
     * and [DeviceContactRepository.pushRoomChangesToDevice] (`roomDto.copy(...)`/`entity.toDto()`),
     * that partial version silently dropped `groupIDs`/`photoRef`/`pgpKey`/`ims`/`websites`/
     * `relations`/`events`/phonetic names/`department`/`customFields`/`pronouns` on every device
     * sync pass — a real data-loss bug this task's device-provider wiring would otherwise inherit.
